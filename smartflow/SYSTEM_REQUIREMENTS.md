   ```javascript
   const departments = [
     { name: 'IT Department', description: 'Information Technology Department' },
     { name: 'HR Department', description: 'Human Resources Department' },
     { name: 'Finance Department', description: 'Finance and Accounting Department' },
     { name: 'Marketing Department', description: 'Marketing and Sales Department' }
   ];
   ```

2. **Roles** (from `clear_and_setup_database.js`):
   ```javascript
   const roles = [
     // IT Department Roles
     { name: 'IT Manager', description: 'IT Department Manager - Third level approver' },
     { name: 'HOD', description: 'Head of Department - Second level approver' },
     { name: 'Line Manager', description: 'Line Manager - First level approver' },
     { name: 'IT Support', description: 'IT Support Technician' },

   ```

### Critical Roles Protection

---

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

### Login Flow
1. User enters credentials (email, employee ID, password)

4. Multi-role users can select their active role

### Role Selection
Users with multiple roles can switch between them:
- Line Manager ‚Üí `/administration/office/linemanager`
- HOD ‚Üí `/administration/office/hod`
- IT Manager ‚Üí `/administration/office/itmanager`
- Department-specific roles ‚Üí Department dashboards
